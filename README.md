# Sales-Funnel-Research
This report comes to investigate user behavior in the company's app that sells food products.  
First we will check the sales funnel, in order to find important information on the users behavior in the app.  
Then we will examine the results of an A/A/B test that checks the impact of changing the fonts for the entire app on the user behavior, 
in order to determine which set of fonts produces better results.
